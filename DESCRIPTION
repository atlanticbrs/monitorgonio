Description: WARNING: this is still very rough. use at your own risk. Just a cobbled together shiny app for visualizing the direction and strength of a ptt using a laptop connected to an Argos Goniometer. It just eavesdrops on the log file. useful because the little handheld can be a pain to read on a bouncing boat.
